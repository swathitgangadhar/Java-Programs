1. # Snake and Ladder: 
 Snake and Ladder is a game played by two players. There are two twists in the game, one is the snake and the laddder. If the player encounters snake, then he/she points will be decreased , if he/she comes across a ladder then his points get increased. In this digital version, for every roll dice a random number within 1-6 gets generated every turn of the player and is added to his previous score. First to win 100 points wins the game.
